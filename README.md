# Â EthSwap

EthSwap is my practice project while learning Web3. The original idea and code was presented by [Dapp University][DappUniversity].
This is a Uniswap-like exchange where you could exchange Eth for a custom token called 'Dapp'. The exchange rate is fixed to 100: for every Eth you'd receive 100 Dapp tokens. Basically, I just followed the tutorial and made this project.
